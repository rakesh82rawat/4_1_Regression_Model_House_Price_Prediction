# 4_1_Regression_Model_House_Price_Prediction
A Machine learning model to predict House Price using Linear Regression and other model regularisation techniques like Lasso and Ridge regression

The task at hand is to predict the price of a house in Hyderabad, India based on a set of given features. To accomplish this, we will build a machine learning model utilizing linear regression, as well as Lasso and Ridge regression for regularization. The dataset, which can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data), contains heterogeneous data that will be pre-processed using column transformers for both numeric and categorical features.
